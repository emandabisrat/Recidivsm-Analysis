This projects analyzes Recedivism Rates and the factors that contribute to recidivism. 

## Background
Recidivism is the tendency of formerly incarcerated individuals to reoffend and return back to prison. This has been a major issue within the criminal justice system for years, and exploring the contributing factors is important when considering why this issue is still prevalent today. Using data from the National Institute of Justice, this project aims to investigate recidivism rates in the first three years post-release in the state of Georgia. 

## Data Sources
The dataset was extracted as a csv from the National Institute of Justice, and it was provided by Georgia Department of Community Supervision and the Georgia Crime Information Center. THe data was last updated July 15th, 2021. It contains approximately 25.8K records and 54 columns of detailed cases on individuals who were released from prison. Some of the key variables included are: Race, Gender, Prior Arrests, Convictions, Offenses, Length of Sentence, Program Attendance, and Supervision Conditions.
